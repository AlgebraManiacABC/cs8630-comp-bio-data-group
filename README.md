# Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC)

## 1. Identification and Links to Dataset
We are using the **Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC)** dataset from Kaggle:  
🔗 [https://www.kaggle.com/code/samiraalipour/genomics-of-drug-sensitivity-in-cancer](https://www.kaggle.com/code/samiraalipour/genomics-of-drug-sensitivity-in-cancer)

This dataset links **drug response data (IC50 values)** with **genomic and tissue information** from various **cancer cell lines**, helping explore how genetics influence drug effectiveness.

---

## 2. Questions We Aim to Answer Through Visualization
- How does **drug sensitivity** vary across **different cancer types and tissues**?  
- Which **drugs** show the highest effectiveness against specific cancers?  
- What are the relationships between **genomic features** and **drug responses (IC50, AUC, Z-SCORE)**?  
- Are there any **patterns or clusters** that indicate potential biomarkers for drug response?

---

## 3. Intended Audience
The visualizations are primarily aimed at:
- **Biomedical researchers and data scientists** exploring drug–gene interactions.  
- **Pharmaceutical analysts** studying drug efficacy trends.  
- **Students and educators** learning how data visualization aids in genomic and drug response analysis.
